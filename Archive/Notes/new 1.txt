Ok. So, I am planning to scale the 'price' and 'comp_x_price' columns. Here's the basic scaling fundamental: the 'price' column will be scaled on the basis of the market threshold prices, i.e., the 'max_price' and 'min_price' respectively. Similarly, the competitor prices will be scaled basis the 'comp_data_min_price' and 'comp_data_max_price'. 

So, we're basically creating a ratio for each price point  in our dataset. Here's a formula to do the scaling:

(max_price - price)/min_price. For the competitor prices, the max_price and min_price will be replaced by the comp_data_max_price & comp_data_min_price respectively.

Ok. Now, I want to create a function to calculate all of this. Here's a pseudocode of my approach:

scaled_prices <- function(df){
                                pat1 <- "price"
                                pat2 <- grep("comp_[0-9]+_price")
								f1 <- (max_price-price)/min_price
								f2 <- (
								if pat1{
