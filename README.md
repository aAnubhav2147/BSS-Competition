**2023 INFORMS BSS Data Challenge**

The 2023 INFORMS Business Strategy Section (BSS) Data Challenge invites participants to dive into a rich dataset provided by Blue Summit Supplies. The challenge aims to identify optimal pricing strategies for various products to maximize the profit.

Briefly, this data challenge seeks innovative solutions to achieve two main goals:

• Determine the optimal selling price for an eCommerce product by leveraging more than two years of
historical data comprising various sales and market variables.

• Predict the expected daily profit for that product given a determined optimal selling price.
The developed solution should ideally lead to more profitable pricing decisions and strategies in a dynamic
eCommerce market.

Approach: We'll utilize a Hierarchical/Mixed-Effect Model to capture the volatility and dynamic Demand Curves of each product. This will be a three-pronged approach as mentioned below:

1.) Create a Hierarchical model to predict the volume sold.
2.) Create a profit function to optimize the profit using the predicted volume.
3.) Optimize the model in tandem with the profit function to get the optimal price point within the requisite constraints.

Please refer to the 'Final Report' folder or the .Rmd file in the 'Codebase' folder for a detailed breakdown and the application of the approach mentioned above.
