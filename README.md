2023 INFORMS BSS Data Challenge
Overview
The 2023 INFORMS Business Strategy Section (BSS) Data Challenge invites participants to dive into a rich dataset provided by Blue Summit Supplies. The challenge aims to identify optimal pricing strategies for various products to maximize revenue.

Dataset
The dataset comprises information on product sales, including features like:

SKU
Product category
Competitor pricing
Sales volume
Cost
And other relevant details
This data spans multiple years and provides a comprehensive view of the sales trends and factors influencing them.

Objectives
Participants are tasked with:

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Understand the underlying patterns, trends, and potential relationships within the dataset.
Modeling: Build predictive models to forecast sales volume based on various factors including product pricing.
Optimal Pricing Strategy: Use the model results to derive an optimal pricing strategy for the products to maximize revenue. This strategy should account for various constraints such as minimum and maximum allowable prices and competitor pricing strategies.
Evaluation
Submissions will be evaluated based on the efficacy of the proposed pricing strategy in maximizing revenue. This includes the accuracy of the models used, the comprehensiveness of the analysis, and the feasibility of the pricing recommendations.

Submission
Participants should provide a detailed report of their analysis, methodologies employed, models developed, and the final pricing strategy recommendations. The report should be clear, concise, and supported by data-driven insights.
